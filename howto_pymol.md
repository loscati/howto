# PyMol Tutorial

Here we have some links to very useful video and script to better visualize with PyMol. An important note about the software is that there are more way to do the same thing and, most importantly, that PyMol allow for a quick but fixed customization alongside a more complex but refined customization by design. This can be challenging to understand when browsing through the menus.

Nevertheless, recall that it is not important to understand every aspect of a software, it is better to have a clear idea of what you what to get because softwares come and go.

Moreover, all settings can be tuned through the UI or the internal command line, which is usually better described in the documentation because of if integration with some Python scripts.

Useful to recall some useful things, e.g. how PyMol can remove automatically all Hydrogen when a structure is imported.
