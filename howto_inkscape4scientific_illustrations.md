## Setup page
- Setup a two columns 4A paper using lines (to draw them: click and drag from the side rules; then you can fine-tuning position them by click on them and set the desired values): this helps you understand dimensions for the final figure (fit into one or both columns) and other details such as the font size (usually, 11 pt)
- A grid can be useful (shortcut: `shift+#`)

## The process to compose an illustration
1. Determine what you want to convey with a figure; show a process, highlight a feature etc.
    Address the sub-points: what people should understand? What part of the protein is relevant? etc
2. Sketch out a rough draft
3. Begin compiling
4. Get feedback

## Using in combination with plots
- Export plots in SVG format to have minimal problems once you import the plot (`MATLAB`, `matplotlib` and others can do it easily)
