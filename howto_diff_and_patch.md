# Use GNU `diff` and `patch` to apply patches to files

Here's a simple example of how you can use the `diff` command to create a patch file representing the changes between two Python scripts and then apply those changes to the original script. For the sake of illustration, let's assume you have two scripts: `original_script.py` and `modified_script.py`.

### Generate a Diff/Patch File

Assuming you're using a Unix-like system (Linux, macOS), you can open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the scripts. Then, you can generate a diff file using the `diff` command:

```bash
diff -u original_script.py modified_script.py > script_changes.patch
```

This command generates a unified diff (`-u`) between the `original_script.py` and `modified_script.py` and saves it in the file `script_changes.patch`.

### Apply Changes to Original Script

Next, you can apply the changes from the patch file to the original script using the `patch` command:

```bash
patch original_script.py < script_changes.patch
```

This command applies the changes specified in the `script_changes.patch` file to the `original_script.py`.

Please note that the `diff` and `patch` commands work best when the changes between the two scripts are relatively straightforward and not too complex. If there are significant structural differences between the two scripts, or if the changes are complex, manual intervention might still be required.

Remember to backup your original files before attempting any changes using these commands to avoid accidentally losing your work.
